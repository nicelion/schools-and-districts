# schools-and-districts
Here is a list of every public school and district in the USA in JSON format.

Why would anyone need this? That's a great question. The purpose of this project was to work with CSV data in JavaScript. I also wanted a list of every school and district in the US withoug having to pay for it. I could only find the list in CSV format, so I decided to convert it into JSON.
